**NEW: 🪙 Zion Gold Bar Classification System** - This repository now includes the Saturn Strata classification system with PDF certificate generation, ENFT token minting, and interactive visualization. [Read more](ZION_GOLD_BAR.md)

**NEW**: This repository now includes the **BLEU Flame™ Market Tier** and **Zion Gold Bar Protocol** - advanced ENFT (Enhanced Non-Fungible Token) systems integrated with blockchain technology, featuring Saturn-Strata resource classification, MetaVault yield generation, and cross-sector income routing.

We've given you both a frontend and backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

You can also run this repository locally by following these instructions: 
1. Clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/github/dotnet-codespaces`
1. Open repo in VS Code

## Getting started

1. **📤 One-click setup**: [Open a new Codespace](https://codespaces.new/github/dotnet-codespaces), giving you a fully configured cloud developer environment.
2. **▶️ Run all, one-click again**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded ports *8080* and *8081* in your browser.
